# PicWise — session handoff

Current state for whoever picks the project up next. Updated 2026-10-08.
`PROGRESS.md` is the chronological log; this file is the "where are we now".

## Where the work is

- Repository: `nikkaradimitris-cloud/picwise.concept`
- **Newest work: branch `ccr-a96ce6ac-g06rcj`.** It holds everything in PR #1 plus the
  mission truth audit of 2026-10-08 and its fixes
  (`docs/picwise_mission_truth_audit_2026-10-08.md`). No pull request is open for it yet.
- PR #1 (`ccr-cbcc1974-i8vmk2` → `main`) is still open. Merging PR #1 alone does **not**
  bring the audit fixes; `ccr-a96ce6ac-g06rcj` → `main` brings both.
- **`main` has neither until merged.** Start new work from `ccr-a96ce6ac-g06rcj` (merge
  it into your branch; never rebase it).
- **Production on `main` still serves the fabricated `/best` pages** (audit finding D1)
  until the audit fixes are merged.
- Hosting: Vercel project `subbycloud/picwise-concept`; domain `picwise.subby.cloud`.
  Entry point `api/index.py` (see `vercel.json`).

## The owner

Not a programmer. Write to them in **Greek**, plain words, short. Explain choices in
everyday terms, give honest numbers, and say plainly what was not done and why. Never
overclaim.

## Rules that do not change

Read in this order before touching anything, every session:

1. `PROJECT_RULES.md` — the operating rulebook, first in the source-of-truth order
2. `docs/MISSION.md` — the mission lock: what every purchase-intent query owes the
   buyer, the product promise ("Enter confused. Leave decided."), the identity PicWise
   must never drift into, and the trust/neutrality commitments. **Every piece of work
   is measured against this file.** Its "First Phase Boundary" section is stale (it
   predates the live app) — see "Known doc conflict" below.
3. `concept.picwise.txt` — the product concept source of truth
4. `docs/` contracts and specs — implementation contracts
5. this file, then the last entries of `PROGRESS.md`

If these layers conflict, do not guess: stop and raise it (PROJECT_RULES section 1.4).

In short:

- every purchase-intent query: exactly 4 choices + 1 recommended, decision labels, CTA,
  direct redirect, tracking event
- no fake data of any kind; no commission-based ranking; missing data uses the enum
  (`not_connected`, `data_not_yet`, `not_applicable`, `unknown`)
- small, closed, tested steps; do not invent business logic (flag a TODO instead)
- section 9 performance: first render < 1.5 s, interactive < 2 s, click → redirect < 300 ms
- stages 23–25 stay `NEEDS_*` until real live proof exists; local fixtures are never live
  proof
- **Amazon is permanently removed** — do not reintroduce it. Awin is the affiliate network.

## Map of the code that matters now

| Area | Where |
|---|---|
| Product concept lexicon (278 kinds, EN + GR names, mega category, `broader`, preference words) | `src/picwise_nlu/product_concepts.py` |
| Understanding: phonetic keys, typo correction with safety fences, specs, product annotation (incl. accessory guard), "did you mean" | `src/picwise_nlu/concept_understanding.py` |
| Selection of the four (concept path, token path with relaxation, family guard) | `src/picwise_providers/search_selection.py` |
| Resolver | `src/picwise_search/live_search_resolver.py` |
| Page text ("Understood as", "Only some of the four match: X (n of 4)", "could not match") | `src/picwise_surface/reference.py` |
| Did-you-mean / broad-suggestion injection, impression events, query log hook | `src/picwise_app/app.py` (`api/index.py` delegates to it) |
| Awin feed loading (`AWIN_FEED_URL` with 6 h reuse, `AWIN_FEED_FILE`) | `src/picwise_providers/awin_adapter.py` |
| Query log for NLU training (inactive until configured) | `src/picwise_app/query_log_sink.py`, `deployment/supabase_query_log.sql` |

Tools:

- `python tools/nlu_misspelling_benchmark.py` — 706 misspelled queries end to end
- `python tools/check_awin_feed.py --url "<feed link>"` — what a real feed will do
- `python tools/nlu_mistake_report.py queries.txt` or `--from-query-log` — lexicon review queue
- `python tools/build_picwise_search_artifact.py` — rebuild the search artifact

Docs: `docs/picwise_misspelling_understanding.md`, `docs/awin_feed_setup_el.md` (Greek
guide for the owner), `docs/picwise_query_understanding.md`,
`docs/picwise_mission_decision_delivery.md`.

## Current numbers (local fixtures only)

- Misspelling benchmark: **96.0% pass, 0 wrong kind of product shown** (was 25.2% / 19);
  unchanged after the audit fixes.
- Test suite, last full run 2026-10-08 after the audit fixes (222 modules, every module
  except the two hour-long ones, one process per module): **1,794 tests, 2 failures,
  48 skipped** (skips need the operator's private feeds). The two failures predate all
  of this work and fail identically on `4475192` (checked in a clean worktree):
  `test_picwise_canonical_vocabulary_registry_stage2`,
  `test_picwise_search_index_generated_blind_stage4` (graph-alias leet records in the
  registry). `test_picwise_learning_stage7b` passes in about 41 min;
  `test_picwise_search_index_blind_evaluation_stage6a` runs over an hour (not run).
- Cold start through `api/index.py`, 19-row fixture: first request 677–724 ms, import plus
  first request 1,045–1,078 ms (target 1,500 ms). A real feed adds its download and parse.

## Waiting on the owner

1. **Merge `ccr-a96ce6ac-g06rcj` into `main`** (it contains PR #1). Until then
   production keeps serving the fabricated `/best` pages (audit D1) and can recommend
   an out-of-stock product (audit D2).
2. **Which four, when many products match equally (audit D4).** Today it is the
   alphabetical order of the title. The Decision Contract leaves the ranking formula as
   `TODO`, so this is a product decision. Recommended option put to the owner: spread
   the four across the price range of the matching products (cheapest, dearest, two
   between) — the concept's own Budget → Premium idea, using only feed facts, and it
   matches the price-rank labels already on the cards. Do not implement without an answer.
3. **Awin**: create the feed link (Toolbox → Create-a-Feed), set it in Vercel as
   `AWIN_FEED_URL`, redeploy. Guide: `docs/awin_feed_setup_el.md` (now also asks for
   `ean, product_GTIN, mpn, condition, is_for_sale, pre_order, valid_from, valid_to`).
4. **Supabase project for the query log — and for click/decision events.** Click and
   impression events live only in a per-process list today (audit D5), so production
   records no click durably. None of the account's three projects is PicWise's (one
   inactive, `taxi-chat` belongs to another app, `mysubby.cloud@gmail.com`). Do not
   create tables in them without the owner saying which; a new project may cost money,
   so ask first.
5. Optional: allow `productdata.awin.com` in the cloud environment's network settings so
   a session can check the real feed.

## Next engineering steps, in order

1. When the real feed is available: run `check_awin_feed.py`, add concepts for the feed
   types it does not recognise (correctly spelled names only), add held-out cases for
   them, rerun the benchmark — wrong answers must stay at 0. Also check, on the real
   feed, how `in_stock` / `stock_status` / `is_for_sale` are populated: a flag column
   that is identical on every row is treated as unpopulated, a varying one is read.
   Re-run the audit's runtime probes against it (open items in the audit's status table).
2. Cold start on a large feed: every serverless cold start downloads and parses the
   whole feed once. Build a prebuilt eligible-product artifact and measure against
   section 9.
3. Once the query log is connected: review `nlu_mistake_report.py --from-query-log`
   regularly.
4. Merge the word-level NLU (`build_local_nlu_intent`, still `insufficient_data` for
   Greek) and the concept reading into one layer.
5. Investigate the two pre-existing registry failures.

## Known doc conflict (unresolved, owner's call)

Three files still describe the project as being in the documentation-only phase:

- `docs/MISSION.md` → "First Phase Boundary": no frontend, no backend implementation
- `PROJECT_RULES.md` section 12 → "Do not build live product UI until mission docs and
  contracts are created and reviewed"
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` → "Current Phase: mission/spec/contracts foundation"

Reality: the app is built and deployed (`PROGRESS.md` stages 16-26, stage 22 live on
`picwise.subby.cloud`). So this text is out of date, not a live instruction to stop.
Every other part of `MISSION.md` — the 4+1 contract, the identity rules, the trust and
neutrality commitments — is current and binding. Nothing was changed in these three
files: correcting the phase wording is the owner's decision, not the engineer's.

## Working gotchas

- Run tests **per module**, a few in parallel; never the whole suite in one process
  (out of memory, hours).
- Tests rewrite `src/picwise_search_memory/artifacts/search_runtime_v1.json.gz`
  (`built_at` only). `git restore` it before committing.
- `test_picwise_search_graph_contracts_stage1db1` fails while `app.py`,
  `live_search_resolver.py` or `reference.py` have uncommitted changes (it diffs the
  working tree against HEAD); it passes after the commit.
- Changing a file listed in `search_runtime_artifact.get_fingerprint_source_paths()`
  requires rebuilding the artifact, or every cold start rebuilds the index live.
- Two route tables: `src/picwise_app/app.py` (local server) and `api/index.py` (Vercel).
- The cloud environment blocks `productdata.awin.com`, `ui.awin.com`, `api.awin.com` and
  `picwise.subby.cloud`.
- A `pkill -f` or `grep` pattern that matches its own command line kills the shell.
- Fixtures use fictional brands, `.invalid` URLs and `data_provenance=local_test_fixture`.
- Secrets: the Awin link contains the account API key; the Supabase `service_role` key.
  Only as Vercel environment variables — never in the repository, a log or a chat.
- `picwise_buying_pages/fixtures.py` (`load_seed_buying_pages`) is fabricated test data
  (formula prices and ratings, "Picwise Demo" products). It must never back a public
  route; `/best/<slug>` and the sitemap publish nothing until pages are built from real
  feed data. `test_picwise_no_fabricated_public_pages` guards this.
- Availability (`offer_health`): every column is read; a stock **word** ("out of stock",
  "OutOfStock", "discontinued", "pre-order") decides wherever it appears; a bare **flag**
  (0/1) decides only where its column varies across the feed. Selection, card fields,
  recommendation and redirect share one context built over the whole feed — pass it on
  (`feed_ctx`) rather than building a new one from a subset.
- Product identity is GTIN, else brand + MPN (`_product_identity_key`); count products,
  not offers, anywhere a "four" is decided.
- A test that renders an empty query schedules a 0.75 s background warm-up; reset it
  (`search_warmup._reset_search_warmup_for_tests`) or it can land in a later test.
- Probe the real path with the deployed entrypoint (`api.index.app`) in-process; the
  audit's probe and adversarial-feed scripts are described in its "Reproduction" note.
